"""M38 in-process coverage of the per-worker process-actors and driver-side edge paths.

``ipc_peer_actor`` and ``http_peer_actor`` are the picklable entry points ``ProcessExecutor`` submits
to its worker pool, so in a real run they execute in *worker processes* where coverage instrumentation
in the driver process cannot see them (the same gap M37 closed for the hub worker entry via
``test_inprocess_paths``). Here we drive the **exact** discovery + reduction protocol the executor uses
(``_peer_ipc`` / ``_peer_http``) but with the actors running in threads, so the actor bodies — and the
worker-process resource cache they reuse — are exercised under instrumentation. We also pin the
driver-side timeout and the worker ``done`` paths. These are WITNESSED end-to-end (root bit-for-bit ==
the flat tree), not smoke calls.
