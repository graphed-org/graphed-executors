"""M38 work-stealing (spike; frozen at P6). On an IMBALANCED workload (one worker's whole range is
heavy), witness — not just assume — that stealing engaged: the heavy owner gave leaves away, peers
processed more than their assigned share, every leaf ran exactly once, the result is unchanged, and
the run is faster. Stealing moves only `process` work; the leaf's owner still reduces it, so the
result is identical to no-stealing and to the canonical SequentialRunner."""

# 4 workers -> worker 0 owns leaves 0..3, all heavy; workers 1-3 own light leaves and go idle almost
# at once. HEAVY is deliberately LARGE (a ~0.8 s owner window vs a few-ms steal handshake): steal
# ENGAGEMENT is intrinsically timing-gated (an idle peer's request must reach the busy owner before it
# finishes), so the witnesses below assert structural counters (`given`/`steals`) while the scenario
# leaves a wide enough window that engagement is reliable even on a heavily contended macOS/Windows CI
# runner. (A tight 0.12 s window flaked there — the handshake didn't always land before the owner was
# done. This sizes the window, not the assertion: per R0.10a the assert is on the counter, not a clock.)

    # the number of grants equals the number of leaves it gave up, and every shed leaf is stolen by
    # exactly one peer. A steal-HALF grant would move several leaves per request (so `given` would be
    # < the leaves shed — a victim emptied into a single bulk transfer); steal-one structurally cannot.

    # slow transport one quick peer may catch several — so it is deliberately NOT asserted.)

    # rather than by wall clock — without stealing worker 0 runs all 4 heavy leaves serially
    # (w0_nosteal.processed == 4); with stealing it runs strictly fewer (asserted above), so the heavy
    # work is genuinely off its critical path. A wall-clock `dt_steal < dt_nosteal` assert is NOT used:
    # on a loaded/slow CI runner the ~0.1 s of heavy work is dwarfed by process+transport noise, making
    # the comparison flaky without proving anything the redistribution witnesses don't already.
