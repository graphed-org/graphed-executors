"""M38 (perf): the IPC peer path resolves each actor's queues from a registry INHERITED via the pool
initializer (``peer_pool_init``) instead of Manager-proxy submit-args — the change that removed the
``multiprocessing.Manager`` server process. The real path runs in worker processes, so the actor
resolution is witnessed in-process (the M37 ``test_inprocess_paths`` pattern); persistent reuse +
straggler drain is witnessed against a real process pool.
