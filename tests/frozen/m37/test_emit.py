"""M37 frozen suite (graphed-exec-local slice): both reference executors EMIT dashboard events, and
do so **passively** — attaching a monitor never changes the reduced result, and a misbehaving
monitor never breaks the run. Worker-side STARTED/FINISHED/ERRORED + driver-side SUBMITTED.

Pinned to ``comms=None`` (the hub monitor seam) since M38: M37 is the hub-path dashboard milestone,
so these assertions exercise the hub collector. Peer-path emission parity is covered by m38
(``test_peer_robustness``). The pin changes only the transport, never an assertion.
