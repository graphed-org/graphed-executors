"""M37 capstone (graphed-exec-local slice): a real ``ProcessExecutor`` run with a live ``Dashboard``
attached — the cross-process + network plumbing end-to-end. Worker events forward over the in-process
side-queue to the driver collector, then over a **websocket** to the Perspective ``DashboardServer``;
per-worker off-thread sampler stack-trees ride the same path and the server merges them into one
flamegraph. The reduced result is **unchanged** by the dashboard's presence.

graphed-debug is a runtime dependency of this package, so importing ``Dashboard`` is in-deps (R13.8);
the dashboard *extra* (perspective/tornado/websocket) is gated with ``importorskip`` so a leg without
those wheels (e.g. free-threaded 3.14t) skips this cleanly.
