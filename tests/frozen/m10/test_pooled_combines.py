"""M10 — pooled combines (finding C.8): tree-reduce combines run on the worker pool, not serially
on the driver thread.

The default driver-side path is pinned by the frozen M7 suite and stays untouched;
``pooled_combines=True`` opts in. Pins: identical results and combine count vs the driver path,
the SAME fixed reduction tree (so results stay bit-identical), combines observed off the driver
(thread idents / worker pids), straggler tolerance preserved, and worker errors still propagate
intact.

M38: these tests pin ``comms=None`` (the hub path). ``pooled_combines`` is a hub-only mechanism — peer
reduction does its combines off-driver by construction and rejects ``pooled_combines`` loudly — so once
peer became the default ``comms``, the pooled-combines feature is exercised explicitly via ``comms=None``.
