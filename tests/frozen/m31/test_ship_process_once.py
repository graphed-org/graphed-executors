"""M31 — the process callable is shipped to each worker ONCE, not once per task.

`concurrent.futures` re-pickles and re-ships a submit's callable on every call, so a Plan whose
`process` embeds a large compiled IR pays that wire cost per partition. M31 pickles the process
once in the driver, broadcasts it to every worker (cached by content hash), and submits only
`(token, partition)` per task. These tests measure that property directly — and pin that the
optimization changed nothing about results, determinism, or the thread executor.
