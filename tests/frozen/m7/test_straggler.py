"""A single slow straggler must NOT block the reduction of the other partitions (tree reduction),
i.e. combines fire as ready instead of waiting for all leaves (plan M7).

M38: this pins ``comms=None`` (the hub path). The ``on_combine`` hook firing *incrementally* (a
combine as soon as its two inputs are ready) is a property of the hub's driver-side tree reduction;
peer reduction does its combines off-driver and reports the count, so it can't assert incremental
ordering. Peer's straggler tolerance — work-stealing — is covered by the M38 work-stealing suite."""
