"""M34 — bounded shared-process cache, broadcast coverage, and the LocalResources dedup.

The M31 ship-once broadcast cached the process per worker but never evicted: a persistent pool
over many distinct plans accumulated every compiled-IR-bearing process for the workers' whole
lifetime. M34 bounds that cache (FIFO, cap _SHARED_CACHE_CAP) in lockstep with the driver's
broadcast-token set, asserts full worker coverage before caching a token (never a silent
under-prime), and reuses the one canonical bounded LocalResources from graphed.core (P3-6/P0-1).

M38: these broadcast-cache tests pin ``comms=None`` (the hub path). The ship-once broadcast is a
hub mechanism — peer reduction ships the process to each worker directly (no per-worker token cache) —
so after peer became the default ``comms``, the broadcast cache is exercised explicitly via ``comms=None``.
