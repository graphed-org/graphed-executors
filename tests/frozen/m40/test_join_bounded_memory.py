"""M40 (B5) — bounded per-worker memory while joining a dest_pid strictly larger than the budget,
including OUTPUT-side duplication (plan §4.2 L629-642, trap 2, ADV-r5.2).

Relational duplication repeats probe columns k times per match, so a SINGLE hot key (all rows key=7 →
one dest) with ``n_left · n_right`` build/probe rows emits ``n_left*n_right`` OUTPUT rows — a joined
dest_pid far larger than any input-derived budget. The kernel must therefore radix-sub-partition and
SPILL (whole partitions to the node-local Store) and STREAM the duplicated output, keeping its live
working set within ``mem_budget_bytes`` — the budget covers OUTPUT too. A full-RAM ``concat`` that
materialises the whole dest in memory blows the budget and fails.

Witnesses:
- (kernel working set) ``witness.peak_join_bytes <= mem_budget_bytes`` — the kernel-measured live
  working set, the direct mirror of M39 ``peak_writer_buffer_bytes`` / M38 ``max_frontier`` (a
  counter, so it is deterministic and CI-stable per R0.10a — a wall-clock/RSS gate would be flaky, and
  the joined result is materialised in ``.value`` so whole-process RSS cannot isolate the kernel);
- (spill engaged, non-vacuous) ``witness.join_spilled_partitions > 0``;
- (real duplication) ``witness.join_output_rows == n_left * n_right`` AND the content equals the
  duplicating oracle — a dedup / grouped impl emits fewer rows and fails;
- (MEASURED corroboration) a ``tracemalloc`` peak taken around ``run_join`` stays below a generous
  full-materialisation ceiling (result + a small multiple of the budget), so a grossly wasteful impl
  that buffers many copies is caught by a real measurement too.
