# m68d frozen suite: driverless service liveness (C + B + A and the port race)

Source of truth: `lanes/htcondor/m68d/plan.md` §2 (the cuts) and §4 (the frozen-test table, rows C1-C6,
B1-B3, A1-A4, P1-P4, L1-L4), and `addenda.md` (A1's absent text is m69b's "ended before it announced";
A2's match subtracts the holders' claims). **Frozen: read-only after the m68d freeze tag.**

## How it runs

- `test_service_failure.py` (C1-C6), `test_announce_wait.py` (A1-A4), `test_port_owner.py::...proc_tree`
  (P4) and `test_service_restart.py::test_a_rerun_waits_for_a_fresh_announce` (B3): every OS, in the main
  matrix's `pytest tests/frozen`. The A rows record the htcondor bindings (`FakeHTCondor`, a fake
  `classad2`), so they need no pool.
- `test_service_restart.py` B1, B1b, B2: POSIX (`announce.py` runs as a subprocess and its child is
  signalled).
- `test_port_owner.py` P1-P3: Linux (the race is replayed against `/proc`).
- `test_liveness_live.py` L1-L4: the `htcondor2` bindings and a personal HTCondor with one simulated GPU
  whose jobs share this host's `/tmp` and run as the test's user (the `test-htcondor` job's pool);
  skipped without the bindings, a failure naming what is missing when no pool answers. They run only
  where a job lists `tests/frozen/m68d`; `ci.yml`'s `test-htcondor` step does not list it yet.

## Files

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `m68d_harness.py` | Accessors for the planned names (looked up in test bodies, so the suite collects before the implementation exists); bounded calls (`run_bounded`, `raised_by`, `wait_for`); `Web` (a counting `LookupFreeHTTPServer`); the plan parts (`GatedGet`, `SlowToLoad`, `RaiseIn`, `StageGet`, `stop_leaf`, `gated_plan`, `stage_plan`, `node_spec`, `given_spec`); the managed child's report (`child_starts`, `end_child`); machine and job ads; announce signing (`announce_node`, `announce_later`); `AnnounceRun` (a bounded `announce.py` process); driver job files (`service_json`, `run_json`, `write_driver_job`, `driver_log`, `site_copy`); the recorded bindings (`FakeAd`, `NodeSchedd` with phased svc0 answers and a query log, `FakeCollector`, `FakeHTCondor`, `record_bindings`). Shipped to pilots as a user module. |
| `m68d_child.py` | The managed child, stdlib only (`<python> m68d_child.py <mode> <port> <report> [arg]`): each start appends `start <pid> <port>` to `<report>.starts`; `<report>.exit.<pid>` makes it exit with that code; modes `serve`, `gated` (binds once a gate file exists, retrying while the port is taken), `slow` (the first start in a cwd sleeps `arg` seconds, then binds, retrying) |

## Traceability

"Fails on main" is the first failure at executors `582d3dc` (macOS for every-OS and POSIX rows; Linux rows
and L1-L4 in `m68b-minicondor:local` with graphed `a51bee4`).

| `...[idle-and-matchable]` | A2 | `TimeoutError` at `timeout_s=0.5` | a deadline on an idle matchable node |

| `...::test_a_removed_service_node_fails_each_driver_try_fast` | A + C live | one driver try, exit 3 (`URLError`), no retry | the 3 × `timeout_s` wait |
| `...::test_a_slow_binding_service_beside_the_driver_takes_another_port` | port race live | svc0 not ready: 501 from the driver's task server until `timeout_s`; DAG failed | P1d on one host |
| `...::test_an_unmatchable_service_node_fails_the_driver_fast` | A2 live | the DAG still running after 300 s | waiting out `timeout_s` on a node that can never match |

## Readings

- A1 asserts the projected query through `NodeSchedd`'s log: the constraint names the DAG and `svc0`, and
  the projection holds `JobStatus`, `HoldReasonCode` and `HoldReason`.
- A2's machine ads give the busy partitionable slot 2000 MiB free of 16000; svc0 asks for 23000
  (above every slot) or 12000 (fits the totals only if the running driver job's 8000 MiB claim is
  ignored).
- C2's htcondor leg writes the pilots' machine ad before they start and a different one for the driver
  afterwards, so `.worker` must come from the pilot.
- L3 delays the driver's first plan load by 20 s (`SlowToLoad`) so svc0 scans the driver's port first,
  and asserts the child's first start was on the driver's port. A run where svc0 starts after the driver
  binds fails on that witness instead of passing without a race.
- L1 kills the child by the pid in its report, so the pool's jobs must run as the test's user.
