"""Peer reduction (M38): the tree reduction runs **across the workers, off the driver**.

The driver is no longer the combine hub. Each worker owns a contiguous **leaf range** and reduces it
with the lazy index tree (:mod:`_reduce`); the partials that straddle a range boundary are handed
**worker→worker** over a :class:`graphed.core.execution.WorkerTransport`. The driver only collects the
final root.

Why it stays **bit-for-bit identical** to the existing (hub) path — even for non-associative float
combines like histogram addition: every node keeps its **global** ``(level, pos)`` identity in the one
fixed ``plan_tree`` (even position = left operand, odd = right, unpaired carries up). Distributing the
*combines* across workers never changes the *grouping*, so the result is the same down to the last
ULP. Determinism is independent of message timing — a parked node waits for its fixed sibling, whoever
sends it whenever.

Ownership routing (the segment-tree merge): node ``(level, pos)`` is owned by the worker holding its
leftmost leaf ``pos << level``. The parent of a pair is owned by the **even** child's owner, so a
worker that forms an **odd** node it doesn't own ships it to that owner; an **even** node parks until
its odd sibling arrives (locally or from a peer). Only the O(log N) boundary nodes ever cross the
wire. Termination is a driver ``done`` broadcast once the root (owned by worker 0) arrives — no
fragile message counting, no barrier.
