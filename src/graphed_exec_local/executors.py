"""Reference single-machine executors (plan M7): a thread pool AND a process pool, both running the
same `graphed.core.Plan` to one reduced result.

Both share the driver below; they differ only in the worker pool and how per-worker `open_once`
resources are held (thread-local vs a per-process global set by an initializer). Fixed partition sets
use the deterministic straggler-tolerant tree reduction; an adaptive `next_tasks` plan uses a running
fold over a partition set discovered from observed timings. A worker failure (thread or process)
propagates to the driver intact — in particular a picklable `graphed.debug.StageError` is re-raised
as-is, never degraded to an opaque string (plan A.3 #8).
