"""The driverless entry: ``python -m graphed_executors.htcondor_backend.driver <dir>``, run inside ONE job.

``<dir>`` (the job's scratch dir, its cwd) holds ``plan.pkl`` (a stdlib-pickled runtime ``Plan``) and
``run.json``. The driver runs the plan with :class:`HTCondorRunner` over :class:`LocalPilots` in its own
slot (``pilots="local"``) or over pilot jobs it submits itself (``pilots="condor"``, to the schedd named
by ``run.json["schedd_locate"]``), and on every exit writes ``result.pkl`` = ``(ok, ExecResult |
exception)`` and ``driver.log`` for the output transfer (``driver.sh`` writes a placeholder of both first).

The plan's services are resolved here, in the driver job, by the engine's three legs: the
``run.json["endpoints"]`` the submitter gave (leg 1), the job's own site row (leg 2), or a managed
start (leg 3), beside the driver or, for a name in ``run.json["announce_only"]``, by the announce of
the run's DAG SERVICE node, to which the driver publishes its url and an announce secret in
``run.json["dag_dir"]``; the run then re-checks and probes them as leg-1 endpoints inside
``runner.run`` and resolves its value while they are still up.

``main`` classifies an exit by phase, and only inside ``runner.run(plan)`` by type:

- 0: done.
- 1: environment, which the job's retries may get past. Anything raised before or after
  ``runner.run(plan)``: reading ``run.json`` or the plan, starting the pilots, and the driver's own
  service set (its endpoints and placement are environment; *this plan's decision*, plan-services D6).
  Inside ``runner.run``: a run whose workers were lost (a ``KilledWorker`` ``StageError``, e.g. every
  pilot preempted; *owner ruling 2026-09-25*), and the run's own service phase (``ServiceUnavailable``,
  ``ServiceUnreachable`` and a probe's raw ``WorkerLost``; *this plan's decision*).
- 3: every other exception from ``runner.run(plan)``: the plan's own error, deterministic, so the job's
  ``retry_until`` (a DAG's ``RETRY driver 2 UNLESS-EXIT 3``) stops retrying it. A ``StageError``
  (*owner ruling 2026-09-25*) or a task's exception re-raised intact, such as a ``ValueError`` (*this
  plan's decision*).
