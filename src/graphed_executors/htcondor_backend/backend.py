"""``HTCondorBackend``: a :class:`SubmitBackend` at the all-False floor whose workers are pilots it
launches itself. Pilots pull pickled tasks from the backend's :class:`TaskServer` and post results
back; the driver resolves future arguments before a task is queued, so pilots never talk to each other.

The backend's service surface is duck-typed, read by the engine's service set (``submit/services.py``):
``site_services``, ``service_hosts`` (which the caller may narrow) and ``service_ports`` come from the
site row, ``advertise_host`` is the task server's host, ``host_identity()`` names the driver's host as
condor writes it for that host's slots, and ``driver_memory_mb`` bounds the services beside the driver (a
driver job's slot ``Memory``; ``None``, the host's physical memory). Attached, the row is the launcher's
profile; in a driver job (``in_job=``) it is the job's own site row. Attached over ``CondorPilots`` on a
row with ``"cluster"`` hosts, ``host_service``/``release_service`` run a service as its own job
(:class:`~graphed_executors.htcondor_backend.services.ServiceJob`) that announces its endpoint to the task
server's ``/announce``: a job no slot of the pool could ever run is removed and refused, and a job waiting
for a slot is waited for with no deadline (an exception leaving the runner's ``with`` block ends the wait),
its ``timeout_s`` counted from its start. A run's service jobs go before its pilots: the first plan's
servers announce before the pilots are submitted, and a later plan's wait with the runner's queued pilots
held and are matched beside its running ones. In a driver job
a managed service starts beside the driver, or, when it is one of the run's DAG SERVICE nodes
(``announced=``), is resolved by that node's announce: the driver job submits no service job.

    launcher's site profile (``generic`` for a launcher without one). ``in_job`` is the site row of the
    driver job this backend runs in (``driver.py`` passes it), else ``None`` (attached). ``announced`` maps
    each service a SERVICE node of the driver job's DAG hosts to the node id it announces under.
    ``service_hosts`` narrows where a managed service may run to a subset of the hosts the row offers
    (``None``: all of them); a host it does not offer is refused before the task server starts.
