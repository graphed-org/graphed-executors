"""``HTCondorBackend``: a :class:`SubmitBackend` at the all-False floor whose workers are pilots it
launches itself. Pilots pull pickled tasks from the backend's :class:`TaskServer` and post results
back; the driver resolves future arguments before a task is queued, so pilots never talk to each other.

The backend's service surface is duck-typed, read by the engine's service set (``submit/services.py``):
``site_services``, ``service_hosts`` and ``service_ports`` come from the site row, ``advertise_host``
is the task server's host, and ``host_identity()`` names the driver's host as condor writes it for that
host's slots. Attached, the row is the launcher's profile; in a driver job (``in_job=``) it is the job's
own site row, and a managed service may start only beside the driver. ``host_service`` is not here:
cluster hosting is a later seam.
