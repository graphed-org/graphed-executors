"""Private worker-side task bodies for `TaskVineExecutor`.

These functions run inside the VineGraph task-runner library on a TaskVine worker (or in-process
under `local-execute`). They are referenced by import from the shipped graph, so the
graphed-executors package must be installed in the worker environment.

Two VineGraph argument rules shape this module:

- a positional tuple whose first element is callable is evaluated as a legacy dask task, so the
  plan's callables travel as one cloudpickled `bytes` blob (a leaf type, never walked or called)
  and are unpickled once per library process;
- dataclasses and tuples inside arguments are walked and copied on every call, so partial results
  travel wrapped in `Partial` (a plain `__slots__` object the walker leaves alone).
