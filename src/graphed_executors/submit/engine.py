"""The generic Plan engine ``SubmitRunner`` over any :class:`SubmitBackend` (plan §1.2).

One engine, N backends — the same factorization as the generic shuffle engine over
``ShuffleBackend``. The fixed path mirrors the local reduction topology EXACTLY: leaves are
``process`` tasks, combines follow the ``plan_tree`` shape as future dependencies, and the driver
takes the value of the single root future (so bit-for-bit equality vs ``SequentialRunner`` is inherited,
not re-derived), raising at the first task that fails. The adaptive path folds completions with ``running_fold`` and cancels outstanding work
on stop. Both are reused from ``graphed_executors.local._reduce`` — no duplication.

The worker seam (plan §1.1, review r1 B1): per-run state travels as a picklable :class:`RunContext`
first argument; per-worker capability (``open_once`` resources + the event transport) arrives via a
:class:`WorkerEnv` a BACKEND installs through its own module-level shim — never via an import here,
so ``submit/`` names dask nowhere and ``test_submit_no_dask_import`` holds.

A submission's scope is its run (plan-services §3.1): ``run`` opens one ``ExitStack`` and registers on
it everything the submission acquires — the plan's :class:`ServiceSet` (``submit/services.py``) when
``plan.services`` is non-empty, then a ``cancel`` of its plan tasks not yet done — so no service,
record or queued task of a run outlives it or reaches another. The body runs on the plan with the
run's endpoints bound (graphed's ``bind_services``, before the first plan-task submit), and the value
is resolved against the plan while its services are still up.
