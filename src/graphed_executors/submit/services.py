"""The engine's service set: resolve each service a plan declares, check it, probe it from a worker, and
release what was started when the submission that started it ends (plan-services §3.1, D2, D10).

A plan's ``services`` are graphed ``ServiceSpec`` requirements; the engine names none of them. A
:class:`ServiceSet` satisfies each spec by three legs, in order: (1) an endpoint the user gave, checked,
and a failing one refuses the run naming it (an explicit instruction is never silently replaced); (2)
the backend's site endpoint for the spec's ``kind`` (``backend.site_services``, duck-typed), checked, a
failing one passed over with the reason kept in the status; (3) a managed start from the spec's
``launch`` recipe: beside the driver (a stdlib ``Popen``) when the recipe has no image and no GPUs and
the backend offers ``"driver"`` in ``service_hosts``, else on the cluster through the backend's
``host_service``/``release_service`` pair (D10: the capability IS the pair of methods). Nothing left
raises :class:`ServiceUnavailable` naming each leg and why it did not apply.

Readiness is :func:`check_ready`, one function every caller runs: where the service runs, then from a
worker. The worker probe is an ordinary ``backend.submit`` of :func:`_probe_services`, which answers
with :func:`host_identity` and each check's reason; it is resubmitted under a fresh key until a host
other than a managed service's own answers, and a service only its own host can reach passes only
when that host is the driver's (one machine). Every acquisition registers its release on an
``ExitStack`` the moment it returns, each release logs its failure and never raises, so the first
exception is the one that surfaces and a raising release never skips a later one.

A service lives in the scope of the submission that started it: :class:`SubmitRunner` enters one set
per ``run`` under that run's nonce. A user keeps a service warm across plans by holding a started set
and passing its :class:`Endpoints` as the runner's ``services`` (leg 1 for every run).
