"""The common submit-backend protocol (plan §1.1).

``SubmitBackend`` names the one mechanism every parallel-execution library in the class shares:
``submit(fn, *args) -> future`` with future-valued args resolved before the callable runs (dask:
worker-side peer fetch; parsl: DFK head-node unwrap; :class:`ThreadBackend`: in-process wait). It
joins the codebase's ``*Backend`` protocol family (``ShuffleBackend``/``JoinBackend`` in
``graphed.core.execution``). This module is **pure typing** — no third-party imports — so the
protocol, the engine, and ``ThreadBackend`` install and run with the base package (no dask).
