"""``ParslBackend`` (plan §1.2): a :class:`SubmitBackend` over a **started** parsl executor used
via DIRECT executor submit — no DFK. The DFK unwraps future args on the head node anyway
(dflow.py:863-901), so it would add a global singleton + config-global retries/caching (fighting the
determinism gate) for zero capability gain; direct ``executor.submit(func, resource_specification,
*args)`` is public (executor.py:690) and measured working with three integration moves the
:mod:`~graphed_executors.parsl_backend.launch` helper encodes.

Per-INSTANCE capability vectors (plan §1.1): ``ParslBackend(HighThroughputExecutor)`` is the
all-seven-False "parsl floor" (future args resolve on the submit host, so ``peer_data_movement`` is
False even when the m47 transport plane exists — setting it True would falsely open the m43
``_require_peer`` gate to head-node routing); ``ParslBackend(ThreadPoolExecutor)`` is the
:class:`ThreadBackend` shape (``peer_data_movement=True`` alone — same-process shared memory). Any
other executor type is refused with a loud ``TypeError`` naming both verified classes.

This module imports NOTHING from parsl at load (the ``_lazy`` accessor + the parsl-free ``_shim``);
``test_parsl_no_cross_import`` pins that importing the package leaves parsl/dask/distributed out of
``sys.modules``.
