"""Inter-worker comms backends (M38): concrete :class:`graphed.core.execution.WorkerTransport`
implementations for single-machine executors.

Two interchangeable backends behind one interface — the seam peer reduction and work-stealing ride,
and the seam a future *distributed* executor reuses unchanged:

- :class:`QueueTransport` — **IPC** (the default). Per-endpoint inbox queue + a registry of peers'
  inboxes. ``queue.Queue`` for the in-process / thread-pool case; a :class:`PipeInbox`
  (``multiprocessing.SimpleQueue``, **no feeder thread**) for the process pool (queue-type-agnostic —
  it only uses ``put_nowait`` / ``get_nowait`` / ``get``). A ``PipeInbox`` send is a synchronous pipe
  write, so it blocks above the OS pipe buffer: a caller that must keep reading (or keep going) hands
  its sends to a separate thread — ``_peer._Outbox`` for a worker, ``_peer.release_workers`` for the
  driver's teardown broadcast.
- :class:`HttpTransport` — **HTTP** over loopback. Each endpoint runs a tiny stdlib ``http.server`` in
  a daemon thread; ``send`` enqueues to a local outbound buffer that a background sender thread POSTs
  to the destination (so ``send`` stays non-blocking, exactly like the M37 dashboard client). Fully
  exercisable in-process (every endpoint a thread); a real distributed executor swaps the loopback
  registry for remote hosts.

Both honour the contract: message order/delivery are not guaranteed, and reduction determinism is the
protocol layer's job (it keys by leaf index).

    API :class:`QueueTransport` uses (``put_nowait`` / ``get_nowait`` / ``get(timeout)``).

    Why not ``multiprocessing.Queue``: that spawns a background **feeder thread per queue** in every
    process that puts to it, so a peer worker writing to its driver + reduction peers ends up with
    ~``log(N)`` extra threads. With workers ≈ cores (the normal HEP batch slot) those idle-but-scheduled
    threads add context-switch pressure that measurably slows the workers' compute (py-spy: 5 threads/
    worker vs the hub's 1). ``SimpleQueue`` has **no feeder thread** — ``put`` writes the pipe
    synchronously under a lock — so a peer worker holds one extra thread, not ``log(N)``. We wait/poll
    the reader side, which exposes ``poll(timeout)``, for the timed receives.

    ``put_nowait`` therefore **blocks** whenever the message exceeds the OS pipe buffer (~64 KB) until
    the peer reads — a reduction partial (many histograms, or systematic universes) easily does, and a
    parked write holds this inbox's write lock against everyone else. Callers keep that safe by never
