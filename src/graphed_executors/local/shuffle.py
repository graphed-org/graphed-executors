"""The two-phase shuffle executor (plan M39 §4): map-write + gather over a ``ShuffleBackend``.

This is the generic exchange/repartition ENGINE, backend-agnostic (it deals only in the opaque
``graphed.core.ShuffleBackend`` primitives — ``partition``/``concat``/``slice_rows``/
``estimated_bytes``/``to_wire``/``from_wire``), so its correctness is witnessed by EXECUTION over
BOTH real backends (the a-BI theme), not merely a §A.4 import lint.

Design (plan §4.0-§4.3, §7):

- **Producer-task granularity** ``T ~ W`` (one producer-task per worker, each coalescing several
  ``src_pid``s), not ``T = N`` src_pids — so stage-1 emits at most **P blocks per producer-task**
  (``O(T*P)``), never the ``O(N*P)`` per-src_pid MxR fragment blowup (§4.0/B, the anti-MxR gate).
- **Coalescing writer** streams sub-blocks into P open per-dest writers, flushing a row-group when a
  writer reaches ``ROW_GROUP_BYTES``, so stage-1 writer memory is **O(P*rg)** (guidance 3), not
  O(total shuffled bytes). ``rg`` is the documented ``ROW_GROUP_BYTES`` knob.
- **Deterministic ascending-``src_pid`` merge** (§4.0): producer-tasks own contiguous ascending
  ``src_pid`` ranges and the gather concatenates them in ascending task order, so a dest's rows
  assemble in a fixed order regardless of arrival — the content-addressed ``dest_block_hashes`` are
  therefore byte-identical across two fuzzed-arrival runs (§7.1 determinism gate).
- **Announcement-independent completeness** (§4.2.1/B1): the gather derives the input set from the
  plan's producer-task set + per-producer-task manifests (a **per-dest GET**, ``O(N*P)`` metadata,
  guidance 1), NOT from pushed announcements — which are demoted to droppable/duplicable hints.
- **Steal + reliable ship-back** (§4.3/NB1,NB2): a stolen producer-task's blocks stay on the THIEF;
  only the tiny manifest is pushed to ``owner(task)`` (retry-until-ack, dedup), and the gather dials
  ``owner(task)`` for the manifest then pulls the block from the thief.

Cluster-sim scope (§6.5): ``comms="ipc"`` runs the K logical nodes in-process (the default, the fast
path every theme but the cross-process one uses); ``comms="http"`` gives each node its OWN
node-local Store and a real HTTP block server bound to a ROUTABLE (non-loopback) address, so blocks
move between distinct node Stores over a real socket on a dialable IP. This is a single-machine
cluster *simulation* of the transport seam — see ``CLAUDE.md`` for the cluster-correct-seam scope.
