"""m44 (b)+(c): the M38 peer reduction hosted on dask workers over ``DaskWorkerTransport``
(m44-transport-plan §1.3). One long-running, strict-pinned, seceded peer task per worker runs the
UNCHANGED ``process_and_reduce`` actor loop; the driver runs the UNCHANGED ``collect_peer_root``
loop over a ``DriverTransport`` (fed by the workers' ``log_event``), always with an explicit
``timeout_s`` so a lost root can never hang it (F3: on ``TimeoutError`` the caller falls back to the
peer task's returned root).

Scheduler graph: exactly k ``_dask_peer_main`` actor tasks (leaves ride the broadcast payload —
no per-leaf futures) + O(1) control (``client.run`` broadcast/purge). Determinism is
``PeerReducer.settle``'s fixed ``(level, pos)`` ownership, independent of dask timing; the same fixed
tree makes the result bit-for-bit the ``SequentialRunner`` baseline.

This module imports the reduction kernels from ``graphed_executors.local._peer`` UNCHANGED and defers
the dask-touching ``.transport`` import into function bodies, so it imports on the dask-free matrix
(F13).
