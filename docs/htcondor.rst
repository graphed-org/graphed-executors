Running on an HTCondor pool
===========================

If your site gives you an HTCondor pool — the LPC, lxplus, or one of your own — graphed can submit
its own worker jobs there and run your plan on them. You need the HTCondor Python bindings and
nothing else: no dask scheduler, no parsl interchange. The worker jobs (pilots) start, call back to
your session, pull tasks one at a time, and are removed when you close the runner.

This page is the how-to. For *why* the answer doesn't move when the pilot count does, read
:doc:`design`.

Try it on your laptop first
---------------------------

The same pilot program runs as local subprocesses, so you can check a plan's wiring before you
queue anything. This needs ``graphed-executors[htcondor]`` only for real jobs; the local run below
works with a plain install. Put the task functions in a module:

.. code-block:: python

    # my_tasks.py
    import numpy as np

    def count(partition, resources):
        return np.asarray([partition.entry_stop - partition.entry_start])

    def add(a, b):
        return a + b

    def zero():
        return np.zeros(1, dtype=int)

and run the plan through two local pilots:

.. code-block:: python

    from graphed.core import Partition, Plan, Task
    from graphed_executors.htcondor_backend import HTCondorBackend, HTCondorRunner, LocalPilots
    from my_tasks import add, count, zero

    parts = tuple(Partition("data", "", i * 100, (i + 1) * 100) for i in range(7))
    plan = Plan(process=count, combine=add, empty=zero,
                tasks=tuple(Task(i, p) for i, p in enumerate(parts)))

    backend = HTCondorBackend(LocalPilots(), n_pilots=2, host="127.0.0.1")
    with HTCondorRunner(backend) as runner:
        result = runner.run(plan)
    print(result.value, result.n_partitions, result.n_combines)

Each pilot announces itself, then the result prints::

    pilot myhost:47041:5c0e9a1f serving http://127.0.0.1:10000
    pilot myhost:47040:b82d4e07 serving http://127.0.0.1:10000
    [700] 7 6

On a pool, only the runner line changes: ``htcondor_runner(site=..., n_pilots=...)`` below.


Read these four before your first pool run
------------------------------------------

.. warning::

   **Pilots import your task functions by name.** A pilot is a fresh Python process in a batch
   slot. It finds ``plan.process`` and ``plan.combine`` by module and name, so a function defined
   in the script you run (``__main__``) or a lambda cannot reach it. The runner checks before it
   submits anything and says so::

       ValueError: pilots import plan.process by name; move <function count at 0x…> into a
       module and pass it in `user_modules=[...]` (__main__.count)

   Put the functions in a file and pass that file in ``user_modules=[...]``; it is copied into
   each pilot's working directory, which is on the pilot's ``sys.path``.

.. warning::

   **Your partial results come back through your session.** Pilots never talk to each other: the
   driver hands each merge its two inputs. Every leaf result and every intermediate crosses the
   machine you run from, so keep a partial result small — a histogram is fine, a per-event array
   is not — or run the job on dask.

.. warning::

   **A pilot runs one task at a time**, whatever ``request_cpus`` asks for. Scale with
   ``n_pilots``, not with cores per pilot; raise ``request_cpus`` only when a single task is
   multithreaded itself.

.. warning::

   **A pilot that dies is noticed after 30 seconds** of silence. Its task runs again on another
   pilot; if that pilot dies too, the run fails with a ``StageError`` naming the partition and the
   last pilot (``host:pid:token``). If every pilot is gone and none is queued, the run fails with
   "no pilots left" instead of waiting.


Installing
----------

::

    pip install "graphed-executors[htcondor]"    # pulls htcondor>=25.13

The bindings ship wheels for Linux (x86_64 and aarch64) only, so the extra installs on a Linux
submit host or inside a Linux container. Importing :mod:`graphed_executors.htcondor_backend` does
not import the bindings; submitting does.


On the LPC
----------

Pilots run inside the coffea image, so the driver runs inside it too, and the pilots get your
driver's virtual environment shipped with them. Three steps, from a ``cmslpc-el9`` login node.

**1. A grid proxy.** The pilots authenticate with it::

    voms-proxy-init -voms cms -valid 192:00

The login nodes point ``X509_USER_PROXY`` at ``~/x509up_u<your uid>``, so that is where it lands, and
where the ``lpc`` site tells the schedd to find it.

**2. The driver inside the image.** Work under your 3-day scratch area — the LPC schedds read
your submit files only from there — and enter the image with the same binds lpcjobqueue's
``bootstrap.sh`` uses. The last two binds hide the login node's ``LOCAL_CONFIG_FILE`` from the
image; without them the bindings stop at ``ERROR: Can't read config source …``:

.. code-block:: bash

    # A recipe: this needs an LPC login node.
    IMAGE=/cvmfs/unpacked.cern.ch/registry.hub.docker.com/coffeateam/coffea-almalinux9-noml:2026.9.0-py3.12
    L=/usr/local/bin/cmslpc-local-conf.py
    WORK=$(mktemp -d -p /uscmst1b_scratch/lpc1/3DayLifetime/$USER graphed.XXXX)
    cd "$WORK"
    printf '#!/bin/bash\npython3 %s.orig | grep -v "LOCAL_CONFIG_FILE"\n' "$L" > .cmslpc-local-conf
    chmod u+x .cmslpc-local-conf
    export APPTAINER_BINDPATH=/uscmst1b_scratch,/cvmfs,/cvmfs/grid.cern.ch/etc/grid-security:/etc/grid-security,/etc/condor/config.d/01_cmslpc_interactive,$L:$L.orig,$WORK/.cmslpc-local-conf:$L
    export CONDOR_CONFIG=/etc/condor/config.d/01_cmslpc_interactive
    apptainer shell --pwd "$WORK" "$IMAGE"

**3. A venv the pilots can unpack.** Inside the image, make a venv on top of the image's packages
and install into it — never with ``pip install -e``: the pilots get a copy of the venv, and an
editable install points back at a source tree they do not have. The runner refuses an editable
install and names it.

.. code-block:: bash

    python -m venv --system-site-packages venv
    venv/bin/pip install "graphed-executors[htcondor]"     # add your analysis package here
    venv/bin/python my_run.py

``my_run.py`` builds the plan and hands it to ``htcondor_runner``:

.. code-block:: python

    # A recipe: this needs the LPC pool.
    from graphed.core import Partition, Plan, Task
    from graphed_executors.htcondor_backend import htcondor_runner
    import my_tasks

    IMAGE = "/cvmfs/unpacked.cern.ch/registry.hub.docker.com/coffeateam/coffea-almalinux9-noml:2026.9.0-py3.12"

    parts = tuple(Partition("data", "", i * 100, (i + 1) * 100) for i in range(7))
    plan = Plan(process=my_tasks.count, combine=my_tasks.add, empty=my_tasks.zero,
                tasks=tuple(Task(i, p) for i, p in enumerate(parts)))

    with htcondor_runner(site="lpc", n_pilots=2, image=IMAGE,
                         user_modules=[my_tasks.__file__]) as runner:
        print(runner.run(plan).value)          # [700]

What happens: the runner picks the least-loaded LPC schedd the way ``condor_submit`` does there,
submits one cluster of pilots with your venv and ``my_tasks.py`` spooled alongside, and waits for
the first pilot before it runs anything. On a September 2026 run, with about 12,700 jobs idle on
the chosen schedd, the first pilot connected 33 seconds after submission and the second after 116;
a busier pool queues pilots for as long as it queues anything else. Leaving the ``with`` block
retrieves the pilots' logs into ``log_dir`` and removes the jobs, which took 15 seconds.


On lxplus
---------

Enter the same image with ``/etc/condor`` and your Kerberos credentials bound, build the venv as
on the LPC, and pass ``site="lxplus"``. The ``lxplus`` site binds the task server to port 8786 on
the login node: batch nodes get ``Connection refused`` on the default range 10000–10100, and 8786 is
the one port CERN opens from workers to a submit host (for a dask scheduler), so **one driver per
login node**. A second ``htcondor_runner`` on the same node fails at once with ``OSError: no free
port for the task server: site=lxplus ports=8786-8786``; log in to another node. The first pilot was
live 105 s after submission on the run this is measured from
(``graphed-workdir/lanes/htcondor/probes/site-check-lxplus/transcript-8786.txt``; the refused
10000 run is ``pilot-logs-run2.txt`` next to it). The lxplus schedd refuses a spooled job that
brings nothing back, which the site handles with ``transfer_output_files=""``.

Pilots run in the ``longlunch`` queue (two hours); pass
``extra_submit={"+JobFlavour": '"workday"'}`` for a longer run, or
``extra_submit={"output_destination": "root://eosuser.cern.ch//eos/user/..."}`` to have the logs
written to EOS instead of retrieved.


On any other pool
-----------------

``site="generic"`` submits to your default schedd with no site keys. The pilots run your driver's
Python directly, so the submit host and the execute nodes need to share that interpreter and its
packages (a shared filesystem, or the same image):

.. code-block:: python

    # A recipe: this needs an HTCondor pool.
    from graphed_executors.htcondor_backend import htcondor_runner

    with htcondor_runner(n_pilots=10, user_modules=["my_tasks.py"]) as runner:
        result = runner.run(plan)              # the plan from the laptop run above

For a site of your own, describe it once as a ``SiteProfile`` and pass that as ``site=``:

.. code-block:: python

    from graphed_executors.htcondor_backend import SiteProfile

    mysite = SiteProfile(
        name="mysite",
        submit={"MY.SingularityImage": '"{image}"', "+AccountingGroup": '"group_physics.{user}"'},
        spool=True,             # the schedd cannot read your submit directory
        ship_env=True,          # send the driver's venv along as env.tgz
        sandbox_root=None,      # or a directory the schedd can read, which log_dir must sit under
        schedd_query=None,      # or (param naming the collectors, constraint) to pick a schedd
        driver_ports=(10000, 10100),  # what the execute nodes can reach on the submit host
    )

Submit values may use ``{image}``, ``{uid}``, ``{user}`` and ``{home}``.


Running without a login session
-------------------------------

``htcondor_runner`` needs your session alive for the whole run: the pilots call back to it. For a
run that should outlive your login, ``submit_driverless`` puts the driver itself in a job. It
pickles the plan, writes ``plan.pkl`` and ``run.json`` into ``log_dir``, and submits **one** job
that runs ``python -m graphed_executors.htcondor_backend.driver``; you get a ``RunHandle`` back and
can log out.

.. code-block:: python

    # A recipe: this needs the LPC pool, from the image and venv of the steps above.
    import os
    from graphed_executors.htcondor_backend import submit_driverless

    work = os.getcwd()                          # under your 3-day scratch area
    handle = submit_driverless(plan, site="lpc", image=IMAGE, n_pilots=8,
                               request_memory_mb=16000, log_dir=work,
                               user_modules=[my_tasks.__file__])
    handle.save("run-handle.json")

Later, from any session on the same pool:

.. code-block:: python

    from graphed_executors.htcondor_backend import RunHandle

    handle = RunHandle.load("run-handle.json")
    print(handle.status())                      # queued, running, held, done, failed or removed
    handle.wait(timeout=3600)                   # returns on done, failed or removed
    result = handle.result()                    # the ExecResult; a failed run re-raises its error

Where the pilots run depends on ``pilots=``:

* ``pilots="local"`` (the default) asks for one slot with ``n_pilots`` CPUs and runs the pilots
  inside it as subprocesses of the driver. This is the choice on the **LPC**, whose jobs cannot
  submit jobs; size ``request_memory_mb`` for all of them together.
* ``pilots="condor"`` has the driver job submit ``n_pilots`` pilot jobs of its own, to the schedd
  your session chose, and host its task server on one of the site's ``worker_ports`` (10000–10100
  on every built-in site). On **lxplus** the pilots need a submit directory the schedd reads, so
  ``log_dir`` must lie under ``/afs``; anything else is refused. A site without ``worker_ports`` refuses
  ``pilots="condor"``.

The job brings back ``result.pkl`` and ``driver.log`` (the pilot count and pids, timings, and any
traceback); on the LPC and lxplus they are spooled and ``result()`` retrieves them into
``log_dir``. ``logs()`` returns the driver's log files that have come back. The job exits 0 when the
plan ran, 3 when the plan itself raised — never retried, since it would raise again — and
1 for anything else, such as pilots that could not start; exit 1 is retried twice.
``handle.remove()`` removes the job. Everything a pilot cannot import (a lambda, a function defined
in ``__main__``) is refused before anything is written or submitted, as for ``htcondor_runner``.


The arguments you will change
-----------------------------

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 26 74

   * - Argument
     - What it does
   * - ``n_pilots``
     - How many pilot jobs to submit. One pilot runs one task at a time.
   * - ``site``
     - ``"lpc"``, ``"lxplus"``, ``"generic"`` (the default), or a ``SiteProfile``.
   * - ``image``
     - The container image; ``lpc`` and ``lxplus`` need one.
   * - ``user_modules``
     - Files or package directories copied next to each pilot, importable there by name.
   * - ``request_cpus``, ``request_memory_mb``
     - Per pilot; 1 and 2048 by default.
   * - ``log_dir``
     - Where ``pilot.<n>.out``, ``pilot.<n>.err`` and ``pilots.log`` land. By default a fresh
       directory under the site's scratch area, or a temporary one.
   * - ``env``
     - The venv to ship on sites that ship one; your driver's own by default.
   * - ``extra_submit``
     - Submit keys added last, so they override the site's.
   * - ``host``
     - The name pilots call back to; this machine's fully qualified name by default.
   * - ``port_range``
     - The driver-side ports the task server may bind, inclusive; the first free one is used. By
       default the site's ``driver_ports``: 10000–10100 on ``lpc`` and ``generic``, 8786 on
       ``lxplus``. A range with no free port is an ``OSError`` naming the site and the range.
   * - ``min_pilots``
     - How many pilots must be connected before the first run starts; 1 by default.
   * - ``retries``
     - Has no effect here. The only retry is the one re-run of a task whose pilot was lost.


When something goes wrong
-------------------------

* **No pilot starts.** After ten minutes the first run raises ``RuntimeError: 0 of 1 pilots
  connected after 600.0s; see the pilot logs in <log_dir>``. Look at ``pilots.log`` there for
  holds, and at ``pilot.0.err`` for a pilot that started and could not reach you — the port range
  has to be open from the execute nodes to your submit host.
* **A pilot dies mid-task.** It is re-run once elsewhere; the second death fails the run with a
  ``StageError`` whose ``partition`` is the chunk and whose message names ``host:pid:token``.
* **A pilot exits with code 2** and prints "wrong secret file": it was pointed at another run's
  task server. Each run has its own secret.
* **A pilot outlives your session.** Once your session has been unreachable for 30 seconds, the
  pilot stops at once, even in the middle of a task, so a crashed driver does not hold batch slots.


Who can talk to the task server
-------------------------------

Each run makes a 32-byte secret, writes it to a file only you can read, and ships the file with
the pilots; it is never in the job's arguments or environment, which anyone who can query the
queue can read. Every request a pilot makes is signed with it, and the task server refuses an
unsigned or wrongly signed request before it reads the request's contents. The traffic itself is
plain HTTP, so tasks and results are readable on the wire: run inside your site's network.
